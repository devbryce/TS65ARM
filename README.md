# TS65
The Split 65% Keyboard

This is a custom 65% style keyboard that is split in the middle to provide a more ergonomic option whilest not being drastically different from the standard stagger used on keyboards

#Features
- Open Source Design
- Fully Programmable Keys
- Split design for better ergonomics, while maintaining the currently "standard" keyboard layout
- PCBs and case designed so that the two sides can be connected into standard 65% without split
- Infinite layers
- Alps & Cherry (PCB and Plate) switches supported
- PCB mount stabs supported
- All keys individually lit. LED on top to maintain compatibility with the few backlit keysets out there
- Either side (Left or right) can be connected to the PC
- 34 SMD (1206) LEDs on the bottom of the PCB for under/side glow
- SMD (SOD-123) diodes only
- Individual resistors for the LEDs not required as it uses a dedicated LED driver
- USB 3.0 Type A and USB Type C are used. The ICED has problems with the microUSB 3.0, the USB Type C should solve this.
- Using larger (0805) capacitors and resistors compared to ICED so it is easier to hand-solder

#Layout options
- Split backspace
- Split left shift
- ISO support
- Off-center capslock
- 2.75 and 1.75 right shift
- Lots of options for bottom row
